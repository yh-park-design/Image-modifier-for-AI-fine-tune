It is made for a personal use and generated by ChatGPT.

This is an automation programme to make an image dataset for AI fine tuning.
It doesn't transform the images directly appliable for fine-tuning since the center of image and the ratio of image can be different according to each image.
However, the objective is to reduce the manual processes as much as possible.

So the functions in this code are:
1. Change the color in Greyscale or Black and White
2. Keep or reduce the size of the image
3. Change output format
4. Rotate the image
