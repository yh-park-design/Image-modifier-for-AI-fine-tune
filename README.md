This is an automation program designed to create an image dataset for AI fine-tuning.

The program does not directly transform the images into a format immediately suitable for fine-tuning, as the center of the image and the aspect ratio may vary between images.
However, its objective is to minimize manual processes as much as possible.

Since it is intended for personal use, the design of the interface has not been a priority.

The functions included in this program are:
1. Convert the image to greyscale or black-and-white.
2. Maintain or resize the image dimensions.
3. Change the output image format.
4. Rotate the image.
